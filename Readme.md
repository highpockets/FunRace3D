
The time it took you to perform the exercise?

It took me the whole 5 hours, but I had to download the specific Unity version, but not complaining.

The parts that were difficult for you and why?

I like spending time to organize my code a bit better, but 5 hours just isnt enough time for that.

The parts you think you could do better and how?

Make a better flying fox mechanic, with the use of joints.

What you would do if you could go a step further on this game?

Make more scenes and more obstacles.

What did you think?

I liked the challenge. I really enjoy the concept and working through it.

I don't have time for comments, :)
